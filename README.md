Shporter - A Flash IDE timeline exporter
==============

Shporter is a Flash extension that exports timeline animation into different formats.
Currently, it only exports to the [Spriter](http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter.htm) format, but many more formats are planned.

Do you have a 2D game with a lot of animated characters with many sequences and frames saved as massive sprites which is resulting in high memory usage and crap performance?
Did you animate it in Flash puppet/modular style? If yes, then you are in luck my friend. 
Shporter will export your Flash timeline animations and keep all your modular data intact. 
Save tons of memory and file space!

## Road Map:
- Export textures and/or animation at a given scale 
- Research the following Unity 2D animation systems for export possibilities
  - [SmoothMoves](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/2844)
  - [EasyMotion2D](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/2138)
- Research Javascript export
- Research Corona export
- Research export to [Spline](http://esotericsoftware.com/) format
